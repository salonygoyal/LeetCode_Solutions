A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

How many possible unique paths are there?


Above is a 7 x 3 grid. How many possible unique paths are there?

public class Solution {
    public int UniquePaths(int m, int n) {
        int[,] dp = new int[n+1,m+1];
        dp[1,1] = 0;
        if(m==1 && n==1)
        {
            return 1;
        }
        for(int i=1; i<=n; i++)
        {
            for(int j=1; j<=m; j++ )
            {
                if((i == 1 && j > 1) || (j == 1 && i > 1))
                {
                    dp[i,j] = 1;
                }
                else
                {
                    dp[i,j] = dp[i-1,j] + dp[i, j-1];
                }
            }
        }     
        return dp[n,m];
    }
}
